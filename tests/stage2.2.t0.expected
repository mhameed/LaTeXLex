Here is some text and then some maths:
$$
\psi : X \rightarrow Y
$$

And some text and now a tabbing env:
\begin{tabbing}
Here is some piece of text \= more text \= still more text \= last text \\
second row \>  more at one tab in \\
third row \> \> more at two tabs in
\end{tabbing}

\begin{verbatim}
