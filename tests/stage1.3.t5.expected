Here is some text and now some maths
$\calA, \calA, \calA, \calA$
$\scrA, \scrA, \scrA, \scrA$
$\frakA, \frakA, \frakA, \frakA$
$\bbA, \bbA, \bbA, \bbA$

And here is a harder one in a sentence \calA
\calA is interesting and then
$$
\calA
$$
and $$\calA$$ and $\calA$

Some harder examples:
$\calA \calB \calC$
$\calA^{\#}$
${\calA} .\calA.$
There is some question regarding what we want the output to be in these cases.

$\bb1$
$1$
$\bb1\bb0$
$\bb10$
