Here is some text and now some maths
${\mathcal A}, \mathcal{A}, \cal{A}, {\cal A}$
${\mathscr A}, \mathscr{A}, \scr{A}, {\scr A}$
${\mathfrak A}, \mathfrak{A}, \frak{A}, {\frak A}$
${\mathbb A}, \mathbb{A}, \bb{A}, {\bb A}$

And here is a harder one in a sentence \mathcal A
\mathcal A is interesting and then
$$
\mathcal A
$$
and $$\mathcal A$$ and $\mathcal A$

Some harder examples:
$\mathcal{A B C}$
$\mathcal{A^{\#}}$
$\mathcal{{A}} \mathcal{.A.}$
There is some question regarding what we want the output to be in these cases.

$\mathbb 1$
$\mathcal 1$
$\mathbb{10}$
$\mathbb 10$
