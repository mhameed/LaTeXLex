description: tests that the right amount of whitespace is left in the file in response to various items that would usually create visual spacing (newlines)

duplicates the contents of t4 by:
* no newlines either side of things such as \medskip
* with broken lines inside the paragraphs, please note that the double spaces arise because of the replacement of a newline with a space when the original author left a space at the end of the line. THis is considered to be correct behaviour presently - verified by MH
